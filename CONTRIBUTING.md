# Contributing to HDL

For your code to be approved, we ask of you the following:

- Attempt to follow the project code style. In config/intellij_formatting/Default.xml you will find an importable code
  style file you can use.
  If you use another editor, you might have to do some manual formatting. Small deviations are not necessarily a big
  deal, but do your best.
- Make sure that your code is tested & fully functional. If possible, create a test file as well.
- Feel free to add yourself to the copyright notice in the file license header, for the files that you have added and/or
  edited.
  Also attach to each file a license header, using the text in the LICENSE file.
- Please document your public methods and add nullability annotations to all method return types, and method parameters.
